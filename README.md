# Reproducible research workflows in python

Python's literate syntax makes it a great tool for tying together the random parts of a typical research project into a reproducible workflow. I'll talk about some of the strategies and tools that I've found useful for conducting reproducible research.

Reproducible research is an important component of open science, and involves being able to recreate whatever conditions were necessary to observe an effect of interest. Today, the most practical form of reproducibility is documenting the steps of a research project as much as possible in code.
