# Adopting open source practices for better science

What can scientists learn from the open source community when it comes to improving the reproducibility of research methods and results? I'll introduce three problems in reproducibility, explain how they've been solved by the open source community, and demonstrate how these solutions can be utilized by scientists to make for better and more reproducible research. I'll cover version control systems, dynamic documents, and "hollow research projects"--what I consider to be the epitome of reproducible research. To close I'll review the empirical evidence that open source practices make for better science, and offer some speculation from the perspective of cultural evolution as to why open source has been so successful.
